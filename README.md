# Kmeans_clustering-and-Data_visualization
Exams have always been important for students and their results even more so. In this project, a dataset has been used to understand how different factors can contribute to the success of a student in their exams.


Materials and Methods:


We have used a data driven approach to understand a few contributers in the success of a student in their exams. We have used Kmeans clustering to cluster the average scored marks of a student against various factors and created bar plots for the same.


Results:

We can see that females perform a bit better than the male candidates. Students who had prepared for the test and completed the course had better results than those who went unprepared. We can also see that the student's whose parents had gone to college and had some degree performed better.

Conclusion:

We can conclude that if the student's home environment pushes them to study and provide them with good resources, student's would perform better in the exams.
